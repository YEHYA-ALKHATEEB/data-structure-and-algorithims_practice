Hour 1 — Strings (Core)

Focus: Reverse, palindrome, anagrams, character counts.

Practice:

Reverse a string

Check if a string is a palindrome

Check if two strings are anagrams

Count the first non-repeating character

Tips:

Use split(), join(), Set, Map.

Normalize strings: lowercase, remove non-alphanumerics.

Hour 2 — Arrays (Core)

Focus: Max/min, remove duplicates, two-sum, chunk arrays.

Practice:

Find max/min in array

Remove duplicates (Set or filter)

Two Sum (return indices)

Chunk array into subarrays of size k

Tips:

Think Map for fast lookups.

Use spread operator and Math.max(...arr) for quick max.

Hour 3 — Hashing & Frequency Counters

Focus: Most common elements, frequency maps.

Practice:

Count frequency of elements in array or string

Find the most frequent element

Detect first non-repeated element

Tips:

Use Map or plain objects for counting.

Useful for anagrams, duplicates, two-sum variations.

Hour 4 — Sliding Window & Two Pointers

Focus: Efficient array/string processing.

Practice:

Max sum subarray of size k

Longest substring without repeating characters

Move zeros to end of array

Container with most water (if time allows)

Tips:

Look for linear-time solutions (O(n)) instead of nested loops (O(n²)).

Two-pointer method is key for string/array optimization.

Hour 5 — Recursion & Math

Focus: Factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, power of 2.

Practice:

Factorial of n

Fibonacci nth number

Check if number is a power of 2

Find GCD of two numbers

Tips:

Write base cases first, then recursive step.

Optional: iterative solutions for speed.

Hour 6 — Mock Run & Review

Pick 3–5 medium difficulty challenges on Coderbyte.

Simulate exam conditions: no external help, time yourself per question (~15–20 min each).

Focus on edge cases: empty arrays, negative numbers, duplicates, special characters.

Review JS/TS syntax patterns (arrow functions, spread, map, reduce).
